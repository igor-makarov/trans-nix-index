# Fills in narHash for revisions that lack one.
#
# build-index.sh computes narHash while it has a revision checked out, so this
# is only needed for revisions whose extraction predates that, or which were
# added to revisions.json without being indexed. By default it only visits
# revisions the index actually references, since those are the ones the GitHub
# fetcher needs; pass --all to cover every revision.
#
# The hash comes from a plain `git archive` checkout rather than a downloaded
# tarball. That is sound because nixpkgs sets no `export-ignore` attributes, so
# the archive and the GitHub tarball contain identical files. Verified against
# 25.05: the locally computed narHash was accepted by builtins.fetchTree under
# pure evaluation, and produced a byte-identical derivation.
