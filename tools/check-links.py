"""Check that every in-repository markdown link resolves.

Two renderers read the same files — GitHub, and tools/render-docs.py for the
website — and both turn a heading into an anchor the same way. A link that is
wrong here is wrong in both places, and the failure is silent: the browser
scrolls to the top of the page instead of erroring. Renaming a heading or a
page is the usual cause.

Checked, for README.md and docs/*.md:

  * `#anchor`            — a heading in the same file
  * `./page.md`          — a file that exists
  * `./page.md#anchor`   — a heading in that file

Usage: check-links.py <file>...
