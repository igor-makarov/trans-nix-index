# Refreshes revisions.json with nixos-unstable channel bumps.
#
# Source is the `nix-releases` S3 bucket, which archives every unstable channel
# ever published. That is the right list rather than "every commit on master":
# a directory appears there only once the channel actually advanced, meaning
# Hydra built it and its store paths are on cache.nixos.org. Commits that never
# became a channel were never fully built, so they were never substitutable.
#
# The git revision is embedded in the directory name
# (nixos-26.11pre1049422.f13ff45afd1b), so the whole list costs a few paginated
# listings rather than one fetch per channel.
#
# A short revision is expanded to a full commit and a date through the local
# nixpkgs clone when there is one, and through the GitHub API when there is not.
# The API path is what lets this run on CI, where a 5 GB clone is not worth its
# minutes; only genuinely new channels are ever looked up, because everything
# already in revisions.json is matched by short-hash prefix first.
#
# Existing entries keep their offset — only new revisions are appended, and the
# file is re-sorted by date. Reordering would invalidate index/versions.json,
# which stores offsets into this array, so it is refused rather than performed.
