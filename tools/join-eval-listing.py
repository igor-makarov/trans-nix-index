"""Join the evaluated store paths against the channel listings, per system.

The inverted join described in docs/store-paths.md. For every (attr, version)
pair in the index, take the store path the pair's closing revision evaluates to
at this system, and keep it only if that exact digest is in the listing that
revision published. The listing is a membership test on a digest here, never a
lookup by name — a name maps to one path per system, which is what handed
x86_64 users aarch64 binaries.

Nothing is guessed. A pair whose attribute did not evaluate, or whose evaluated
path Hydra did not build for this system, carries no entry at all and lands in
the misses file; `fast.*` throws for it and names the eval selector.

Listing membership is the cheap proof, not the only one. A listing describes a
single evaluation, so a path Hydra built in a neighbouring one — firefox at the
2026-08-17 tip, for instance — is absent from it while sitting in the cache all
the same. --probe-cache asks cache.nixos.org directly for the paths the listing
did not vouch for, which is a stronger proof than membership rather than a
weaker one: the narinfo either exists or it does not.

Two modes. A full run resolves every pair from the evaluations and listings on
disk — the backfill, which wants a file per revision. An incremental run is
handed the previous artifacts with --prev-dir, keeps every pair that closed
before they were cut, and recomputes only what has moved since: the pairs that
closed at a newer revision and the tip. That is what makes the hourly job need
evaluations for the new bumps alone rather than for thirteen years.

Outputs (into --out-dir), all keyed by the same `system`:
  outpaths-<system>.json      closed pairs: attr -> version -> [digest, name-if-differs]
  tip-outpaths-<system>.json  pairs still current at the newest revision indexed
  outs-<system>.json          digest -> {output suffix -> digest}, the siblings
                              of a multi-output package, keyed by the parent
                              path rather than by a derivation name that several
                              packages can claim
  misses-<system>.json        [attr, version, reason] for every pair with no entry
  manifest-meta.pkl           digest -> {narSize, fileSize, narUrl, refs} for the
                              2012-2013 bumps, whose MANIFEST carries what a
                              narinfo would and whose paths cache.nixos.org no
                              longer serves. Written once, not per system: it is
                              keyed by digest like the graph it feeds.
