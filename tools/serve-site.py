"""Serve the built site out of $SITE_ROOT, for local testing.

Not a bare `python -m http.server`: every file in a store output carries the
epoch as its mtime, so If-Modified-Since would 304 a file from a *previous*
build — the browser then shows a stale site across rebuilds no matter what
changed. Ignore conditional requests and forbid caching outright; this server
exists only for testing. (GitHub Pages serves real validators, so the deployed
site is unaffected.)
