"""Check evaluated store paths against the channel listing that shipped them.

Before spending a machine on a backfill, confirm
that evaluating a revision at an explicit system lands on paths the channel
actually published. Every attribute an evaluation resolved falls into one of
three buckets against its revision's listing:

  built      the exact digest is in the listing — Hydra built this path
  differs    the derivation NAME is in the listing but under other digests, so
             either the listing's copy is another system's build of the same
             name, or the revision has drifted evaluating under a modern Nix
  absent     the name is not in the listing at all — unfree, unsupported, or
             never built for this system, and correctly carries no entry

`built` is the number that matters; `differs` is the drift signal the
name-keyed pipeline could not produce at all, since it took whatever digest
sat next to the name and called it a match.

Wants the per-revision eval files from tools/eval-outpaths.sh and the listing
pickles from tools/fetch-store-paths.py.
